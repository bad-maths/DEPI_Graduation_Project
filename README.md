# DEPI Graduation Project – Time Wallet

**Time Wallet** is a mobile application designed to help users manage and track their time as if it were money.  
Each minute represents a valuable unit that can be spent or saved. The app aims to enhance productivity, focus, and self-awareness by visualizing how users “spend” their time and encouraging them to use it wisely.
